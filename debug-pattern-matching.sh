echo "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the pattern '„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ|Hello' being too broad."
echo "It's matching 'Hello' somewhere in the terminal output before you expect it to."
echo ""
echo "To debug this issue:"
echo ""
echo "1. Run RuleAgents with debug logging enabled:"
echo "   cargo run -- --debug -c test-config.yaml"
echo ""
echo "2. Look for these log messages:"
echo "   üîé New content to check: <content>"
echo "   ‚úÖ Pattern matched! Pattern: <pattern>, Capture: <content>"
echo ""
echo "3. Common solutions:"
echo "   a) Use more specific patterns:"
echo "      - Instead of: 'Hello'"
echo "      - Use: '^Hello$' (exact line match)"
echo "      - Or: 'Hello, what.*' (match specific phrase)"
echo ""
echo "   b) Use word boundaries:"
echo "      - Pattern: '\\bHello\\b' (matches whole word only)"
echo ""
echo "   c) Make patterns context-specific:"
echo "      - Pattern: 'Assistant:.*Hello' (matches Hello only after Assistant:)"

echo "Example of a more robust config:"
